These women are greatly suppressed due to the patriarchal nature of their society and have little or no access to education. They are denied the right to choose their husband and often face a high level of verbal, physical and sexual abuse within their family circle and community. This is why HANDS OF FIRE MINISTRIES AND TRUST Trust was born in 2008: to empower these deprived women. And big vision To Construct HOME for Homeless people.
